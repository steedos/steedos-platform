  edit, or delete child records. This field applies only to master-detail or
  junction object custom field types. true—Allows users with “Read” access to
  the master record permission to create, edit, or delete child records. This
  setting makes sharing less restrictive. false—Allows users with “Read/Write”
  access to the master record permission to create, edit, or delete child
  records. This setting is more restrictive than true, and is the default value.
